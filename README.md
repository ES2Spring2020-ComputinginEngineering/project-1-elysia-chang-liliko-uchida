*****************

In order to get our results, please refer to the following links on our GitHub:

In the Step 2 Folder:
     - Please click on step1_theoretical_period.py
     (This python file shows our working on how we calculate the period of a theoretical pendulum)
     
*****************

In the Step 3 Folder:
     - Please click on "twelve.csv", "fourteen.csv", "sixteen.csv", "eighteen.csv" and "twenty.csv" to access our five micro:bit data collection files for testing our parsing code
     (These csv file names refer to our chosen testing lengths of 12 inches, 14 inches, 16 inches, 18 inches and 20 inches)
     - Please also refer to logger.py and receiver.py
     (These python files shows our code on how we were able to collect data in Part 3)
     
*****************

In the Step 4 Folder:
     - Please click on AnalysisofResults.py for our official finished Part 4 code which draws on our own thinking with the help of Jenn's starter helper code
     (This python file shows our start to finish code on how we approached Part 4 of the project, from parsing in and reading the csv files to calculating the period of the pendulum for each respective trial)
     - If you would like to see more on our own original thinking, please refer to AnalysisofResults(using_our_data+code).py to see our initial steps on approaching Part 4 of this project before spring break

*****************

In the step 5 Folder:
     - Please click on NumericalSimulationModel.py to see our final update of Part 5 of our Project
     (This python file shows our numerical simulation model code & we've included comments throughout to show our thinking)

If you follow all of these instructions, you should be able to run the .py files to get the results

We have also submitted a Google Doc Presentation on our Project 1 Report on Canvas that elaborates on our thinking in more detail. Please check that out as well to get the full picture of our Project 1!
