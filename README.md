Team Name: Group 15

In order to get our results, please refer to the following links on our GitHub:

STEP 2
     - Please click on step1_theoretical_period.py

STEP 3
     - Please click on "twelve.csv", "fourteen.csv", "sixteen.csv", "eighteen.csv" and "twenty.csv" to access our data collection files
     - Please also refer to logger.py and receiver.py

STEP 4
     - Please click on AnalysisofResults.py for our official finished Part 4 code which draws on our own thinking with the help of Jenn's starter helper code
     - For more on our own thinking, please refer to AnalysisofResults(using_our_data+code).py to see our initial steps to approaching Part 4 before spring break

STEP 5
     - Lastly, please click on NumericalSimulationModel.py to see our final update of our Part 5

If you follow all of these instructions, you should be able to run the .py files to get the results

*****************

Your primary tasks will be to:

- build a pendulum,
- use theoretical equations (from physics) to calculate the period of the pendulum,
- collect real-world experimental data from your pendulum,
- create a computer simulation of your pendulum numerically,
- plot and extract meaningful results 2 through 4

Your final submission should include (on GitHub):

All of your updated Python files
A README.md file explaining what .py files to run to get your results
A .pdf file containing your final plots and a brief report and discussion of results
At least five micro:bit data files from a pendulum for testing your parsing code.
